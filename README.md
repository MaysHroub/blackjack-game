# BlackJack Game üÉè

This is the 'Build a BlackJack Game' part of 'Learn JavaScript' couse by Scrimba. It demonstrates building a simple BlackJack game (which I still don't know how to play).

You can access the deployed project [here](https://beautiful-cannoli-649a17.netlify.app/).

Oh, and this is my second frontend project in my *"developing my frontend skills to become a full-stack developer so I can land a good job"* journey. 

### This part of the couse illustrated several topics, including:
- How to declare and use arrays
- How to declare and use objects
- booleans
- `if-else` statements
- Comparison operators
- Difference between == and ===  (=== is just more strict)
- Logical operators
- `for` loops
- The `Math` object and its methods: `random()` and `floor()`
- `return` statements in functions
